âœ… Git Fetch & Related Commands â€“ Quick Reference

ðŸ”¹ git fetch
Fetches all remote branches and updates your local copy of them (like origin/master, origin/dev, etc.)

Does not change your current working branch

Safe way to see what's new on the remote without affecting local code
----

ðŸ”¹ git fetch origin
Same as above, but only fetches from the origin remote (usually GitHub)

----

ðŸ”¹ git fetch origin master
Fetches only the master branch from origin

Updates origin/master locally

Useful when you want to update just one remote branch

------

ðŸ”¹ git merge FETCH_HEAD
Merges the most recently fetched commit (from git fetch) into your current branch

Common pattern:

git fetch origin master
git merge FETCH_HEAD

---

ðŸ”¹ git log origin/feature_branch
Shows the commit history of the remote feature_branch

Lets you inspect whatâ€™s new before merging or rebasing

---

ðŸ”¹ git checkout origin/feature_branch
Checks out the remote branch in a detached HEAD state

Useful to view the remote branch without affecting your local branch

Tip: You cannot directly commit on this â€” use git checkout -b mybranch origin/feature_branch to create a local tracking branch

-----

ðŸ“¦ Where Are Fetched Branches Stored?

After running git fetch, the fetched remote branches are stored as:
origin/<branch-name>

They are:

Read-only references to the remote branches

Available for viewing, diffing, and merging

Not merged into your local branch until you explicitly do so

You can list them with:

git branch -r
